# project-mask_detect
Summary: The aim of this project is to explore the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in image classification. The team will build a web application using a Covid-19 facemask dataset. The dataset will have two distinct labels (with_mask vs without_mask). The model will be trained using the dataset to detect if someone entering some premises is properly using their face masks.
