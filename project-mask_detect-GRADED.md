### Presentation (15/15)

The presentation was well-organized and covered the the important points of the project. 
It make very good use of visuals, and included an effective product demonstration. It 
highlighted the purpose of the project, how the team was organized, major features, the 
application architecture, the technologies used, the development tools, the repository 
organization. It also made good use of team members making different parts of the 
presentation. It was also notable for providing a basic introduction to the AI functionality 
for those not familiar with convolutional neural nets (CNNs).


### Repository (15/15)

The history of the development is reasonably reflected in the repository history. The 
repository has 7 branches with a reasonable number of commits to each branch, demonstrating 
that the development process made significant use of branches. Pull requests were also used. 
One branch was unmerged
